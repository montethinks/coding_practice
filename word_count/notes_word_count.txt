input: a phrase as a string
output: hash with each word and its count as Integer

algorithm:  - split the string by any punctuation (,.@#$%^!:;)
              - downcase all words
            - find regex for non word or non integer character
            - iterate through the collection of words
            - each word is a key += 1 for each value
