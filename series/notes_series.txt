Write a program that will take a string of digits and give you all the possible
consecutive number series of length n in that string.  
For example, the string "01234" has the following 3-digit series:

- 012
- 123
- 234
And the following 4-digit series:

- 0123
- 1234
And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, 
you deserve whatever you get.

'01234'

input: string of numbers and a slice_count
output: an array of arrays (slices)
rules: - start from the beginning of the string
       - return the beginning of the sting through the slice_count of chars
       - pointer tracks the current_position
       - the size of the string minus the current_position

algorithm: convert the string to an array of integers
           iterate through the array of integers
           slice slice_count of integers into a results array
           return the array
             array size - slice count 5 - 2 = 3
                                      5 - 4 = 1
